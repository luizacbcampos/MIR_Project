# Original dataframes folder

This folder contains the original dataframes found at [The Pudding's GitHub](https://github.com/the-pudding/): `data.csv` and `full_repeat_years.csv` albeit some data parametheres we manually filled (such as gender).

This folder also contains 2 dataframes `merge.csv` and `outter_merge.csv`. We used `outter_merge.csv` in our analysis.
